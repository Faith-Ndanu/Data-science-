It contains stacks and tuples files and their descriptions.
## TUPLES
A tuple is an ordered collection of elements enclosed in parentheses or normal brackets. They are immutable, meaning their values can’t be changed once assigned.
They are ordered meaning that, the elements in a tuple have a special position or index. They can contain elements  of different data types, allowing flexibility in storing and organizing heterogeneous data. Items in a tuple  are accessed through indexing, starting from index 0 for the first item. You can’t add items directly to a tuple because it’s immutable. Instead, you can create a new tuple by concatenating an existing tuple with a new one using the + operator. They can be used to create keys in dictionaries allowing data retrieval and organisation


## STACKS
It is a container in which insertion and deletion can be made from one end known as the top of the stack. Stacks follow the last-in-first-out principle meaning you can only access the topmost element in a stack. The order in which elements are added determines the order in which they are removed. A simple stack is created using the append method,accessing items in a stack is done by  using the peek() method which retrieves the top item in the stack without deleting it. Items in a stack can be removed using the pop() method. The push and pop operations make it easy to add and remove elements from the top of the stack.
